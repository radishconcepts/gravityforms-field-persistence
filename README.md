# GravityForms Field Persistence plugin

This plugin makes it able to save users data, in order to prefill the data in other forms on the site.

## How does it work?
This plugin uses the dynamic input name, which can be entered in a Gravity Forms field. As long these names are the same across different forms, the fields will be automatically populated. 
The data will be stored in a cookie. 

Since all the functionality is handled by Javascript, it will also work on site with Varnish cache.

## What fields does it support
Currently only text and textarea fields are supported. We will add more fields along the way. Please also submit you requests as an issue!
